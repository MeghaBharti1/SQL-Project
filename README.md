# SQL-Project
The student database design outlined in this project provides a
robust framework for efficiently managing student information
within an educational institution. By carefully considering the
various entities, attributes, and relationships, we have created a
structured database schema that captures essential data about
students, courses, grades, and Instructors. Through the use of
appropriate data types, constraints, and normalization techniques,
we ensure data integrity, minimize redundancy, and optimize query
performance. Additionally, by incorporating features such as
authentication and access control, we enhance security and privacy.
